    "$The IQR analysis flagged items priced above $57.50 as outliers, which at first glance could be interpreted as noise or data quality issues. However, looking more closely at these records shows that many of them are perfectly valid within their business context. For example, items such as Chanel handbags and diamond engagement rings naturally appear at much higher price points and should not be treated as errors simply because they fall outside a statistical threshold. In another case, a $2,000 Mary Kay listing initially looks abnormal, but the item description reveals it represents a bulk sale rather than a single product.\n",
    "\n",
    "These examples also highlight several data quality concepts discussed in Week 3. The Mary Kay listing represents a pattern violation relative to typical makeup prices, even though the value itself is valid. The diamond ring entry illustrates incompleteness, as the brand name is missing despite the high price of the item. In addition, all of these high-priced items have low item_condition_id values (1 or 2), reinforcing the strong relationship between item condition and price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this analysis shows that the detected outliers are genuine extremes rather than random noise. Removing them would result in the loss of meaningful and potentially important data. A more appropriate approach for future modeling would be to keep these observations and apply techniques such as log transformation to handle the wide range of prices.$"
